**Moreyball** is the philosophy, named after NBA executive [Daryl *Morey*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daryl_Morey), of optimizing for the most efficient shots in basketball: dunks and threes.

**Moreyball Percentage** (**MB%**) is the percentage of a player's shots taken either within 3 feet of the basket or behind the three point line. All shots in the exclusion zone (between the three point line and the restricted area) are excluded.
