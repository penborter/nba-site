**Moreyball Percentage** (**MB%**) is the percentage of a player's shots taken either within 3 feet of the basket or behind the three point line. All shots in the exclusion zone (between the three point line and the restricted area) are, well, excluded. 

Moreyball Percentage = (Attempts<sub>within 3FT</sub> + Attempts<sub>3PT</sub>) / Attempts<sub>Total</sub>

For reference, the league-wide MB% is <mark>still to be calculated</mark>. Note that this isn't the league *average*, but is a league-wide calculation of shots outside the exclusion zone divided by total shots.
