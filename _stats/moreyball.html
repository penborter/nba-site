  Currently the below shot charts are just PNGs generated through a scheduled GitHub action; the plan is to update this to an interactive graph at some point.

<p>
  For comparison, here's the shot chart for T.J. McConnell, who is currently last in the league in MB%, hovering right around 0.400. Note the missed backcourt heave above his right ear.

  Cleveland holds four out of the top six spots on the leaderboard, then a big jump to Caris LeVert ranked 67<sup>th</sup> (MB% 0.845).
</p>
<p>
  Houston's highest MB% player (Tari Eason) ranks only 144<sup>th</sup> in the league with a MB% of 0.782, the lowest ranking for a team leader in this weird stat. Interestingly, Dallas is second lowest, with Daniel Gafford leading the team with a still-respectable 0.800 (ranked 118<sup>th</sup>).
