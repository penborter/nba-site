  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/i9_MxNIX05o">Dean W.</a> remains the league leader in Moreyball Percentage.
  The race has tightened, though, and by the end of the season I think it'll be worth plotting the change in the league leaders over time. Sam Merrill and Dean W. are neck and neck, with Sam on a lot more volume.

  Currently the below shot charts are just PNGs generated through a scheduled GitHub action; the plan is to update this to an interactive graph at some point.

<p>
  For comparison, here's the shot chart for T.J. McConnell, who is still comfortably last in the league in MB%, hovering just above 0.400. Note the missed backcourt heave above his right ear.

<p>
  Cleveland holds four out of the top five spots on the leaderboard, then a big jump to the next Cleveland player JaVonte Green, ranked 60<sup>th</sup> (MB% 0.843).
</p>
<p>
  Houston's highest MB% player (Tari Eason) ranks only 136<sup>th</sup> in the league with a MB% of 0.777, the lowest ranking for a team leader in this weird stat. 
  Memphis is in a similar boat, if you exclude Jay Huff (who is 8<sup>th</sup> in the league). After that, their next-highest player is GG Jackson, ranked 135<sup>th</sup> with a MB% of 0.779.
