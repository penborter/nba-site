  The leaderboard of the players with the highest <a href="/posts/moreyball-percentage">Moreyball percentage</a>, updated weekly on Mondays.
  A more detailed table is available <a href="/stats/moreyball-full">here</a>, and the raw .csv is saved <a href="https://github.com/penborter/nba-data/blob/main/data/dynamic/NBA_Leaders_MOREYBALL_Rate.csv">here</a>.

  Sam Merrill has taken over as league leader from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/i9_MxNIX05o">Dean W.</a> in what is effectively a dead heat (0.9563 vs. 0.9558 — less than one shot either way).
  The race has absolutely tightened, and by the end of the season I think it'll be worth plotting the change in the league leaders' percentages over time. Sam Merrill and Dean W. are neck and neck, with Sam on a lot more volume.

  Currently the below shot charts are just PNGs generated through a scheduled GitHub action; the plan is to update this to an interactive graph at some point.

<p>
  For comparison, here's the shot chart for T.J. McConnell, who is still comfortably last in the league in MB%, hovering just above 0.400. Note the missed backcourt heave above his right ear.

  Cleveland holds four out of the top five spots on the leaderboard, then a big jump to the next Cleveland player JaVonte Green, ranked 60<sup>th</sup> (MB% 0.843).
</p>

<p>
  Collectively, though, Chicago has the lowest median MB% ranking of 90.5, while Phoenix has by far the highest, way up at 293.5.
  Despite covering the top of the leaderboard, Cleveland sits right around the middle on average, with a median MB% ranking of 202. 
</p>

<p>
  Houston's highest MB% player (Tari Eason) ranks only 136<sup>th</sup> in the league with a MB% of 0.777, the lowest ranking for a team leader in this weird stat. 
  Memphis is in a similar boat, if you exclude Jay Huff (who is 8<sup>th</sup> in the league). After that, their next-highest player is GG Jackson, ranked 135<sup>th</sup> with a MB% of 0.779.
