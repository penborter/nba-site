<h2>Discussion</h2>
<p>
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/i9_MxNIX05o">Dean W.</a> remains the league leader, as he has through most of the season. Those shots on the edge of the restricted area are suspect, though, and at least one of them was a floater where he took off from outside the restricted area.

  Currently the below shot chart is just a .png generated through a scheduled GitHub action; the plan is to update this to an interactive graph at some point.

<p>
  For comparison, here's the shot chart for T.J. McConnell, who is currently (as of 2025-01-19) last in the league in MB%, at a low 39.1%. Note the backcourt heave dot behind his headshot.
